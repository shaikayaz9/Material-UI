Typography
Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

Customization
Adding & disabling variants
In addition to using the default typography variants, you can add custom ones, or disable any you don't need. See the Adding & disabling variants page for more info.

Changing the semantic element
The Typography component uses the variantMapping prop to associate a UI variant with a semantic element. It's important to realize that the style of a typography component is independent from the semantic underlying element.
To change the underlying element for a one-off situation, like avoiding two h1 elements in your page, use the component prop:

<Typography variant="h1" component="h2">
  h1. Heading
</Typography>

const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiTypography: {
      defaultProps: {
        variantMapping: {
          h1: 'h2',
          h2: 'h2',
          h3: 'h2',
          h4: 'h2',
          h5: 'h2',
          h6: 'h2',
          subtitle1: 'h2',
          subtitle2: 'h2',
          body1: 'span',
          body2: 'span',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});


use this code 
   <Button variant="contained">Hello world</Button>;
      <Typography variant="h1" gutterBottom>
        ayaz shaik h1
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h1" gutterBottom component="h2">
        ayaz shaik h1
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h1">ayaz shaik h1</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h2">ayaz shaik h2</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h3">ayaz shaik h3</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h4">ayaz shaik h4</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">ayaz shaik h5</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h6">ayaz shaik h6</Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1">ayaz shaik subtitle1</Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle2">ayaz shaik subtitle1</Typography>
      <Typography variant="p">ayaz shaik p</Typography>
      <Typography variant="button">ayaz shaik btn</Typography>
